# The Museum: School of Steel Cages

## Guide 
This game is basically an adventure-dungeon-crawler, so...
* In the beginning of the game, you use the "[ MAP ]" to move around.
* During dungeon crawler sequences, eat food to regain health.
* Looting is key.
* Be patient with the game. Some sequences might take a long time, but they'll eventually get to the point.
